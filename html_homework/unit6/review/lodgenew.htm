<h2>Devon Valley Film Festival Meals and Lodging</h2>
<p>Devon Valley has plenty of places for you stay during the film festival, which runs from July 1 through July 7. Below is a list of the hotels that we have partnered with to offer a package deal for the entire week. You pay one price for admission to all the films, guest panels, and "meet and greet" sessions.</p>
 
<p>Additional packages are available for an all-inclusive meal and transportation plan. There are three different meal plans, ranging from simple continental breakfast each day to a plan that includes breakfast,lunch, and dinner each day. Transportation packages are also three-tiered, with budget-friendly packages for bus travel, taxi, or private limousine service.</p>
 
<p>Lodging plans are available for one through seven days. Guests who purchase our <em>ValleyVisit</em> package must stay at least two nights. There are budget, economy, and first-class hotels in the Devon Valley area. All the hotels are within a short drive to the film festival. The Devonshire Grand Hotel is located right here on the grounds of the film festival. Please call well in advance of your stay, as booking for these rooms has a very high demand.</p>
