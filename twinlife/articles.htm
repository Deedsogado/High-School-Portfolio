	<p>Switching Roles
<br />===============

<br />By Karen Kerkman, PhD</p>

<p>Role playing is a common twin behavior. One twin will become the leader and the
other will become the follower. One may become the talker and the other, the
listener. In some cases, these roles become permanent and the behavior
associated with those roles become part of the child's personality. In many
other cases however, these roles will be switched on a periodic basis, leaving
their confused parents' heads spinning! This behavior can be found in other
sibling pairs, but it is most pronounced with twins.</p>

<p>Twins also seem to know much more about each other and what the other one is
thinking. Twins will typically excel at guessing games. Twins seem to be
sensitive to both verbal and non-verbal clues. It is possibly this intimate
understanding of one another, that allows them to switch their roles so
quickly. There almost seems to be an unspoken understanding between the twins,
"okay, now I'll let you lead for awhile." For the casual observer, this can
be very disconcerting. Despite the stories that sometimes appear in magazines
and tabloids, there is no evidence that this unspoken communication amounts
to ESP or any other unexplained phenomenom.</p>

<p>When twins swap roles, it makes it difficult for others to maintain a
clear idea of their separate natures. Lacking a clear division of personalities,
it is more difficult for others to tell the twins apart. Hence, we are more
likely to group the twins as a unit, rather than as separate individuals.</p>

<p>As twins grow older, they may increasingly dislike this grouping and strive
to establish completely unique identies. Parents may want to help this
process along in a healthy and beneficial way. You should encourage the 
aspects of each twin's personality that seems to be unique to him or her.
The parent can be a great helper in giving the twin a sense of individuality
without losing the special bond shared with his or her twin.

   <p>Twins and Talking
<br />=================

<br />by Peter Kuhlman, PhD</p>

<p>Communication occurs long before speech. Babies communicate with their
parents through crying, laughter, smilying and pointing. The attentive
parent quickly becomes attuned to this "non-speech" communication. At some
point, usually in the second year of life, babies will begin to add a single
words to these acts of expression. A baby will point to a cup and say, "drink."
The names "Mama" and "Dada" are among the first out of the baby's mouth.</p>

<p>As the child gets older, he or she will add new words to these expressions and
will begin to use words in combination: "get drink me." The parents provide
visual and audio feedback to the child, encouraging the development of
the speech process. Through a process called "echoing", parents will naturally
repeat what their child says, proving an important confirmation that what
the child has said has been heard and understood.</p>

<p>With twins, the situation may be slightly different. Often parents cannot
provide the one-to-one feedback that single children routinely enjoy. It
may be that the one most often listing to the twin and providing feedback is
the other twin.</p>

<p>While the other twin is usually a very attentive and eager audience, he or
she can not provide the type of feedback needed for language development. Twins
can not correct each other's mistakes in the use of words or grammar. Moreover,
by communicating with each other, twins are necessarily decreasing the amount
of communication they are performing with adults and older children. In some
cases, twins become such good audiences for each other, they lose interest
in communicating with their parents.</p>

<p>In rare cases, this one-to-one communication can progress to the point at
which a shared language is created. The twins will come up with their own
words, and in some cases, their own grammatical structures. The languages
are unintelligible to anyone else but the twins. These cases are very rare,
even though they are well publicized. The twin's secret language will usually
disappear by age 4 or 5, as the children become more adept at using their
parent's language.</p>

<p>What can you do to help your twins in acquiring language? The most important
thing you can do is pay individual attention to each child. Easier said than
done! Provide feedback to the child as he or she gropes with language.
If you are feeding your twins, talk to one child as the other is eating. 
Then, when the first child is eating, switch to the second. When changing
diapers, use the one-on-one time (one hopes) to further provide the
audio clues needed for picking up speech.</p>

<p>As with everything that is twin-related, language acquisition requires some
extra work on the part of the parents; but again with twin-related activites,
the extra work is paid off in extra fun.</p>
