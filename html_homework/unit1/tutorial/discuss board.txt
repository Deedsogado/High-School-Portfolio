	Prior to taking this class, I didn't know that HTML stood for Hypertext Markup language. And, I was under the impression that XHTML was the same thing as HTML. However, now I know that HTML is a language, while XHTML is a set of rules for syntax and commands.  
	In unit 1 I have learned about the basic structure of HTML pages.I also learned what each tag does, and that to add more than one tag to a text, you must "nest" it between the tags of another.  I learned that HTML works like peotry, using a rhyme scheme of ABBA; any tag that you open, you must close with a forward slash. This applies to both two-sided tags, and empty tags. 
	
	I think web design is always getting more advanced, improving in both speed and usability.  Due to this, I think that it will become easier for more people to make webpages without knowing any of the HTML behind their GUI. We already have programs which allow you to make websites using click-and-drag methods, and I'm proud to have the opportunity to learn the language "behind the scenes."
	Jobs available to web developers can range from building a modest site for yourself, to monitoring e-commerce between corporations. With the knowledge that I take from this class, I plan to continue learning other languages like python, C++ and Java, until I become a really good programer and software developer.  I have a driving interest in seeing my work come to life, and I take pleasure in making tings works, so programming is perfect for me. I might even try game scripting in hte future, who knows?
