# [High-School-Portfolio](http://deedsogado.github.io/High-School-Portfolio/)

Product of my very first IT-related course. Homework page links to class Midterm, Final, and other exercises completed during my high school HTML course, which I completed through the Idaho Digital Learning Academy (IDLA). 

Note that this was completed in 2010 using scripts that were, at the time, up to date. Now many of those scripts have been moved, deprecated, or otherwise broken and thus do not load. For the most part, this doesn't affect normal operation or layout of the web pages, but it does affect the [homepage of the Final project](http://deedsogado.github.io/High-School-Portfolio/twinlife/index.htm) where it leaves a blank space below the nav bar where an activeX plug-in used to be.
