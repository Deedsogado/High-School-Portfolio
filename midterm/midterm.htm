<h2>In McCall Idaho</h2>

<p>I have played on Payette lake since my first trip to <em>Camp Morrison</em>, whose water-front is on the Eastern Shore.  There I was introduced to canoeing and kayaking.  Just recently I went on a High Adventure Trip with my quorum and we did some white water rafting, hiking, and <strong>jet skiiing</strong>.  White water rafting and jet skiing are now my two favorite activities on the water.</p>
